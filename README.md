# **Eastern quoll movement and association**

Here we describe the analyses we conducted for our article Wilson *et al.* "*Everybody needs good neighbours: movement, habitat use, and conspecific association in a reintroduced mesopredator*", currently under review.

**Abstract**

As a reintroduction progresses through the establishment, growth, and regulation phases, density-dependent mechanisms increasingly drive population dynamics. This can complicate efforts to reinforce these populations if the translocated individuals (henceforth reinforcers) are excluded, or existing residents become displaced. This is especially pertinent for islands and fenced reserves, where immigration is only possible by translocation. Conspecific associations offer insights into how these density-dependent mechanisms manifest in space and time.

We investigated how movement, habitat use and preference, and conspecific associations differed between eastern quoll (*Dasyurus viverrinus*) residents and reinforcers in a [conservation-fenced haven](https://www.mulligansflat.org.au/). We used GPS collars to quantify distances travelled per night, home and core ranges, nocturnal (activity) and diurnal (denning) habitat use and preference, and conspecific associations across three periods: baseline (residents only), release (both cohorts), and settlement (reinforcers only).

Eastern quolls travelled consistent distances per night (1.75 km ± 0.08), but despite this, reinforcers had significantly larger home ranges (249 ha ± 53) and greater overlap with other collared eastern quolls (115 ha ± 15) when compared to residents (range 90 ha ± 11, overlap 46 ha ± 4). We found significant habitat preference toward grassland (over woodland, regrowth, and forest) in both nocturnal locations and diurnal dens across all animals, and significantly more den sharing in residents (49%) as compared to reinforcers (26%). Finally, we found significantly lower movement correlation during the settlement period, and, surprisingly, for fawn-morph animals compared to dark-morphs.

Our results revealed short-term movements, habitat use and preference, and conspecific associations at a greater spatio-temporal resolution than has ever been achieved for this species. Our findings offer important insights into appropriate habitat structure for future reintroduction sites, and confirm the need for intensive post-release monitoring to inform adaptive management interventions to promote positive outcomes for both initial trials and later reinforcements.
